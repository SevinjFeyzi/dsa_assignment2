# Part D: Reflection - [Your Name]

## 1. Individual Contributions

I took the lead in completing all parts of the assignment. 
My responsibilities included tackling Part A, B, and C, 
where I implemented various features, such as the undo button 
and a deep level of recursion for determining the best move. 
I focused on ensuring the functionality of the game while navigating 
through the intricacies of pygame and logic implementation.

## 2. Learning Experience

This assignment provided me with valuable learning experiences. 
Firstly, I gained proficiency in using pygame, 
a skill that was essential for creating an interactive game environment. 
Additionally, I delved into the intricacies of deepcopy operations, 
optimizing game strategies, and developing an understanding of 
how to implement an optimal game approach.

## 3. Most Challenging Aspect and Overcoming Challenges

Part A, B, and C each presented unique challenges, 
but Part B stood out as the most demanding. 
Crafting the correct logic for the game 
and devising an optimal strategy that passed all test cases required meticulous planning. 
Overcoming this challenge involved a deep dive into the intricacies of the game's logic, 
iterating through various strategies, and celebrating the successful execution of the game. 
The satisfaction of witnessing my game run smoothly was a rewarding outcome of overcoming these challenges.
